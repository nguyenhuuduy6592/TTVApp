# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Google's Gemini AI API into the TTV app to enhance the quality of translated chapter content.

## Key Changes
1. Replace CLI arguments with configuration file
2. Add Gemini API configuration (API key and model selection)
3. Maintain both original and enhanced versions of chapter content
4. Add available models documentation file
5. Implement simple retry mechanism for enhancement failures
6. Make AI enhancement optional based on API key presence
